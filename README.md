# Birds-Image-Classification
The Birds Image Classification project aims to develop an image classification model capable of identifying 20 different bird species. The dataset consists of 3208 high-quality training images, 100 test images, and 100 validation images. Each image contains a single bird, occupying at least 50% of the pixels.

Key Details:
Dataset: 20 bird species, each with 3208 training images, 100 test images, and 100 validation images.
Image Size: 224 x 224 x 3 (JPG format)
CSV File: Contains image file paths, class labels, scientific names, dataset categorization, and class index values.
Goal: Train an image classification model to achieve mid-range accuracy on both training and test sets.
Model: Utilize deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) to build and train the classification model.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the test set.
